## SLIME

The slime stays away from the player trying to shoot from the distance. His attacks aren't specially strong but he can be quite annoying in groups. The player should try to kill them as avoiding their projectiles might be hard while shooting at other enemies. However, they are very weak and easy to kill.
- slime type attacks
- high attack range
- low attack speed

## DRIADE

The driade stands in a middle ground between the golem and the slime. They aren't especially strong or fast but their attacks can be dangerous if the player isn't careful. They are support golems with gas and plant attacks which will force the player to move constantly to avoid getting damaged greatly.
- gas and plant attacks
- medium attack range
- mid attack speed

**Enemy Attack** – a mechanic that allows enemies to perform offensive actions against the player. It is used to challenge the player, creating a direct threat and the risk of losing resources, such as health, forcing the player to react, adapt, and manage their survival during encounters.
## Description
Each enemy executes attacks according to its **behavior pattern** and attack logic. Attacks can be only ranged projectiles, or area-of-effect abilities, depending on the enemy type.

The timing, range, and effect of each attack are defined by the enemy’s AI and may vary based on current [[Difficulty|difficulty level]] or environmental conditions. Attacks require the player to dodge to avoid taking damage.

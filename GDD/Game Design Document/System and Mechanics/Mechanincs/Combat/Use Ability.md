**Use Ability** – a mechanic that allows the player to use a special ability that affects movement. It is used to enhance exploration and mobility during fights. 
## Description
Before each expedition, the player can buy one ability from a set of available abilities in the shop. 

Abilities modify the player’s movement in a unique way, for example by granting temporary invulnerability frames, or boosting speed. During the expedition, the selected ability can be activated by [[Controls|pressing the designated ability]] button. 

This mechanic encourages strategic planning before entering the magical realm and adds depth to traversal during exploration. Abilities are limited to one active choice per expedition, making the selection meaningful and impactful.

Every ability has a cooldown and a duration of its effect, meaning that the player cannot spam the use of abilities. Also, abilities might have a different duration until their effect disappears, for some abilities this might be instant, but for others it could mean that the effect last a couple of seconds.
## Available abilities
### Dash
When the player dashes, his speed is increased greatly for a very short amount of time. This allows the player to make quick moves at certain moments in combat, avoiding projectiles or attacks easily.

### Invisibility 
The player becomes invisible for a certain amount of time. Enemies will not be able to see him while the ability is active. This allows the player to quickly disengage combat in dire situations.

### Force field
When the player uses force field, all enemies near the player are pushed back with great force in opposite direction. This give the player space whenever he is surrounded by enemies. It also separates the enemies from each other.

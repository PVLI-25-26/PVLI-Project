**Set Arrow Path Modifier** – a mechanic that allows the player to alter the trajectory A core mechanic that defines the ballistic properties of all fired projectiles by selecting different bow types with distinct physical characteristics.

## Description
The player [[Shop|can equip]] one bow type before entering the magical realm. This selection determines the fundamental trajectory characteristics of all arrows fired during that expedition. Unlike special ability modifiers, these bows alter the core physics of arrow flight through variations in gravity, air resistance, and maximum range. The system provides a tiered progression from close-range to long-range combat styles, allowing players to adapt their approach to different dungeon layouts and enemy encounters.
## Available Trajectories

### Short Bow (Starter Equipment)
**High arc, short range** – The default bow with pronounced gravitational pull and significant air resistance.  
Arrows follow a **steep parabolic path** ideal for **confined spaces** and **close-quarters combat**. The rapid descent makes it less affected by camera rotation changes, providing consistency in tight dungeon corridors.  
Perfect for new players learning the basics and for rooms with low ceilings or narrow layouts.

### Medium Bow (Balanced Upgrade)
**Standard arc, versatile range** – A balanced upgrade offering moderate gravity and air resistance.  
Arrows travel with a **classic parabolic trajectory** suitable for **most combat situations**. This bow excels in **medium-distance engagements** and provides reliable performance across varied dungeon room designs.  
Acquired through early-game progression as the first meaningful upgrade to the player's arsenal.

### Long Bow (Precision Weapon)
**Shallow arc, extended range** – An advanced bow with minimal gravitational effect and reduced air resistance.  
Arrows maintain a **flatter, extended trajectory** that travels **much farther** in a **near-straight line**. This allows for **long-distance precision shots** and effective sniping in open-area encounters.

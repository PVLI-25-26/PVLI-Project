**Rooms paths** â€“ A mechanic that allows the player move across rooms.
## Description
Each room is hand-crafted and has a fixed number of paths, each of which take the player to another room.
When the player interacts with a path (with the [[Dialogue system]]), the player is transported to the connected room through that path. The player also spawns on the path that takes him to the previous room.

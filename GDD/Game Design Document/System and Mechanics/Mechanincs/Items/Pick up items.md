**Pick Up Items** â€“ a mechanic that allows the player to collect items found within the dungeon.
## Description
When the player approaches an [[Use Item]] and presses the [[Controls|interaction button]], the [[Interaction]] will pop up, showing basic information of the item and asking the player if they want to pick it up or not.
If the player decides to pick it up, the item will get added to the item list inside the player's inventory.

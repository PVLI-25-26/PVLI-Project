**Interact** â€“ How the player interacts with items and NPCs.
## Description
The player will interact with the world through the dialogue system. 
When the player approaches an interactive target, they will be able to push a button to open the interactive dialogue.
A bubble will appear over the target containing the text of what is being said or the description of the action to perform. The size of the bubble will vary depending on the amount of text.
A portrait will appear next to the bubble.
Below the bubble, there will be one or two options to choose from. These options can perform another dialogue, exit the dialogue, or perform a specific action.

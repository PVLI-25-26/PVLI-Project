**Enemies difficulty** â€“ How the difficulty of the enemies increases as the difficulty level increases.
## Description
The difficulty increases with each level for all the enemies (bosses and small enemies).
Each enemy has a set of three stats, one for each level. This gives us more flexibility in designing the areas.
